  <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>In this experiment, we would like you to imagine that an alien race has
    been discovered!</p>
    <p>We have collected examples of <b>four</b> different kinds of alien artifacts,
    and we would like your help to study them. We have already sorted the
    artifacts into bins, one bin for each kind of artifact. Within each bin,
    we need you took look at pairs of the same kind of artifact and tell us
    how similar you think they are to each other.</p>
    <p>The more similar you think the artifact examples are, the closer your
    answer should be to the phrase "Completely the same". The more different
    you think they are, the closer your answer should be to the phrase
    "Completely different".</p>
  <p>Please click "Begin" when you're ready to start.</p>
